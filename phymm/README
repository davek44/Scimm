SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

- You'll need a local copy of the standalone BLAST
  software; this can be downloaded for your local
  platform from
   
 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/NEWEST_VERSION

  where NEWEST_VERSION represents the most recent
  version number.  (Navigate to the "release"
  directory to find out what the most recent version
  number is.)

- At least 50GB of disk space should be available
  for installation.

- 1GB of free memory is preferred; 750MB will suffice;
  500MB or less will likely cause problems.

- You'll need to have a relatively modern version
  of Perl installed, including the Net::FTP package.

INSTALLATION:

To install, run "phymmInstall.pl" from this directory.

The installer will download all the current bacterial &
archaeal genomic data from RefSeq, set up needed metadata,
and build the IMMs that comprise the core of the Phymm system.

It'll also build a local BLAST database representing
all the genomic data from RefSeq.

TO CLASSIFY READS:

With your set of query reads saved into a multi-FASTA
file (make sure each read has a *unique* identifier
immediately following the '>' on its comment line),
run "scoreReads.pl <query-read file>".  Result files
will be generated for Phymm, BLAST (using the local
database constructed during installation), and PhymmBL
(a weighted combination of the two designed to maximize
accuracy).

NOTES:

Please note that the IMM-construction portion of
installation is particularly computationally intensive;
full installation (including ICM construction) took
about 24 hours on an Altus 3400 server with a 4x Opteron
850 processor, 32GB of memory, and no significant
competing processes running during that time.

Breakdown of our test installation, on the server
described above, measured in wall-clock time:

   BEGIN			       00h 00m 00s
   
   RefSeq download complete	       00h 15m 43s
   
   .genomeData/ directory populated
   with downloaded data, organism
   directory-names standardized,
   taxonomic metadata files for
   Phymm generated, and included
   GLIMMER code compiled	       00h 41m 10s

   IMM construction complete	       22h 56m 14s

   local BLAST database construction
   complete (END)		       23h 00m 34s

Note that after the installer has assessed whether it
should use a new copy of the RefSeq data or work from
an existing one, the interactive portion of the installation
is complete, and you won't need to actively monitor the
installation.

For classification, note that Phymm runs in time comparable
to BLAST; 5,730 100-bp query reads took 36.3 minutes to
classify with Phymm, and the same set took 26.9 minutes to
search for matches in the local database using BLAST.

Combining scores to find the best consensus match for
each read (i.e., the final, PhymmBL, step) will require
500-700MB of free memory.
